 Restaurant Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a **Restaurant Recommendation System** using a content-based filtering approach. The system is designed to suggest restaurants based on user preferences, leveraging restaurant data for personalized recommendations.

Features

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations are made based on restaurant features like cuisine, location, ratings, etc.
- **User-Centric Suggestions:** Matches restaurants with user preferences for better accuracy.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays recommendation results in a user-friendly format.
- **Scalable:** Easily adaptable to larger datasets or additional features.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install using `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Restaurant_Recommendation_System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Restaurant_Recommendation_System
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Dataset

- Ensure the dataset files (`restaurants.csv` and `user_preferences.csv`) are present in the `data/` folder.
- Replace or update the dataset with your own data if needed.

Running the Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook resturant_recommendation_system_using_contentBased_data.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build and evaluate the recommendation system.
   - Generate and visualize recommendations.

Customization

- Update `user_preferences.csv` with new user data for personalized results.
- Modify feature engineering or similarity computation logic in the notebook as needed.

 Outputs

- Recommended restaurants are displayed in the notebook after running the script.
- Results can also be exported to a file in the `outputs/` folder.

 Future Enhancements

- Integrate collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
- Add a user interface for easier interaction.
- Deploy the system as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
